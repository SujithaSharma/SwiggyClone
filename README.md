I am going to create a project called Swiggyclone which is comparably similar to swiggy functionalities.

Getting started with a Progressive Javascript Framework Vuejs.

Here are some reasons why Vuejs is so popular:

         i) It has very less number of commands for installation, whcih makes it easier to get started
         ii) It runs on javascript with some HTML and CSS which makes it easier to learn
         iii) It is best for beginner to create a website from scratch
         
Commands to get started with Vuejs:

          i)  npm install -g @vue/cli => To install vuejs latest version 4.5.13
          ii) vue create your_projectname => to create a new project
          iii)npm run serve => To compile the project
          iv) npm run build => To build a production environment
          v)  npm run lint => To check for linting errors
